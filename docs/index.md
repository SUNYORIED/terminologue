# Hello.

This website is where you will find technical documentation on the [Terminologue](https://www.terminologue.org/) terminology management system. If you want to tinker with Termminologue's source code, understand how it works and perhaps even run your own instance of Terminologue on your own sever, then this reading material is for you. If, however, you only want to *use* Terminologue, then this is not for you, you should go to [www.terminologue.org](https://www.terminologue.org/) instead and start by reading the [Gentle introduction to Terminologue](https://www.terminologue.org/docs/intro.en/).
